<div align="center"><h1>School project thingy</h1></div>

Im putting this on github and even @ItzCryptonized can't stop me!

### Project Brief
The brief was to solve the problem of homeless people not being able get jobs and earn money for themselves.

My solution was to electronically add a suit onto someone's webcam.
The intention was to make it easier to apply apply for jobs by eliminating the need for someone to buy a suit just to attend an interview.

### Usage
Just `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run `main.py` and your good to go.
I will add a release later (when it's not 1am)

### Credits
